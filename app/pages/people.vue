          The Pamir people live in the Pamir Mountains, a high-altitude region in eastern Tajikistan, northeastern Afghanistan (Wakhan Corridor), and parts of western China and Pakistan. This region is often called the "Roof of the World" because of its extreme elevation.They are sometimes referred to as Pamiris, and they belong to several Iranian ethnic groups with unique languages, traditions, and histories.
          Fun Fact: Many Pamiri people are multilingual, often speaking Russian, Tajik, or Dari alongside their native language. </p>

Wakhan People
        </h3>
        <p class="sm:text-lg mt-6">
          They speak Pamir languages, part of the Eastern Iranian branch of the Indo-Iranian family. These languages are distinct from Tajik (a variety of Persian). Some of the major Pamiri languages include:
          The Wakhi people, also known as Wakhan people, are an ethnic and linguistic group native to the Wakhan Corridor — a remote, mountainous region in eastern Afghanistan. They are also found in:

          Tajikistan (mainly in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region — GBAO)

          Pakistan (in Gilgit-Baltistan, especially in Hunza and Ishkoman Valleys)

          China (in the far western Xinjiang region)

          They are one of the Pamirian peoples, sharing cultural and spiritual traditions with other groups living in the Pamir Mountains.

          Children in the Pamir Mountains
        </h3>
        <p class="sm:text-lg mt-6">
          Children of the Pamirs grow up in one of the most remote and beautiful mountain regions in the world. Their daily lives reflect the strong values, culture, and traditions of the Pamiri communities — found mainly in Tajikistan, Afghanistan (Wakhan), Pakistan (Hunza, Ishkoman), and parts of China (Xinjiang).
          Children grow up in high-altitude villages surrounded by snowy peaks, rivers, and valleys.

          From a young age, they help their families with:

          Herding animals (yaks, goats, sheep)

          Farming (potatoes, barley)

          Collecting water and firewood

          Despite hard conditions, children are active, strong, and close to nature.
          Religious and Moral Education

          Most Pamiris are Ismaili Muslims, and children learn values such as:

          Peace, tolerance, and respect

          Helping others

          Importance of knowledge and ethics

          Children attend Jamatkhanas (community centers) to learn about their spiritual heritage.

          Pamiri Man
        </h3>
        <p class="sm:text-lg mt-6">
          A Pamiri man is traditionally a hardworking and resilient mountain dweller. Living in the high Pamir Mountains, he often works as a farmer, herder, or craftsman. He values family, community, and spiritual life deeply, usually following Ismaili Islam. Pamiri men wear warm, handmade clothes suitable for harsh mountain winters and participate actively in cultural traditions such as music, dance, and festivals. Respect for elders and hospitality are important parts of his daily life.
